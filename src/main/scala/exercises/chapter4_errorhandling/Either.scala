  /*
  Exercise 4.8
  In this implementation, map2 is only able to report one error, even if both the name and the age are invalid.
  What would you need to change in order to report both errors? Would you change map2 or the signature of mkPerson?
  Or could you create a new data type that captures this requirement better than Either does, with some additional
   structure? How would orElse, traverse, and sequence behave differently for that data type?

  There are a number of variations on `Option` and `Either`. If we want to accumulate multiple errors, a simple
  approach is a new data type that lets us keep a list of errors in the data constructor that represents failures:

  trait Partial[+A,+B]
  case class Errors[+A](get: Seq[A]) extends Partial[A,Nothing]
  case class Success[+B](get: B) extends Partial[Nothing,B]

  There is a type very similar to this called `Validation` in the Scalaz library. You can implement `map`, `map2`,
  `sequence`, and so on for this type in such a way that errors are accumulated when possible (`flatMap` is unable to
  accumulate errors--can you see why?). This idea can even be generalized further--we don't need to accumulate failing
  values into a list; we can accumulate values using any user-supplied binary function.

  It's also possible to use `Either[List[E],_]` directly to accumulate errors, using different implementations of
  helper functions like `map2` and `sequence`.
